Iterating on React Native module development. This app pulls the native module java sources into the app directly as experiment on faster native coding turn-around.

With project open in Android Studio and Instant Run active, it's fast to make Java changes and re-run the app from Studio. **Demo2** is attempt to install the module in `node_modules` and make updates directly on the files in `node_modules/aeris-android-rn`. That is not seeming to work as well as gradle needs cleaning and re-running.
